2. Build Time Optimization:
a. Current build times: ~5-7 minutes
b. Improvements:
- Using multi-stage builds
- Caching apt packages
- Implementing BuildKit
- Using slim base images where possible
- Parallel package installation
- Layer optimization

4. Monitoring Solutions:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Alert Manager for notifications
- Custom metrics for:
  * Resource utilization
  * Application health
  * Response times
  * Error rates
- Loki for log aggregation
- Kubernetes events monitoring
- Resource quotas and limits monitoring

5. Memory-Intensive Workloads (100-250GB):
a. Data to Code Architecture:
- Use memory-mapped files (mmap) for large datasets
- Implement data partitioning
- Use distributed caching (Redis/Memcached)
- Consider Apache Arrow for efficient memory usage
- Implement lazy loading where possible

b. Memory Monitoring:
- Use cAdvisor for container metrics
- Implement custom memory monitoring with Prometheus
- Set up OOM monitoring and alerts
- Use memory profiling tools
- Monitor swap usage and page faults
- Implement memory leak detection
